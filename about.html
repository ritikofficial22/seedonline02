          <h2>What We Are?</h2>
          <p>
            SEED (Support for Employability and Entrepreneur Development) is a
            program working for government and non-government firms on multiple
            projects. We take projects from companies and hire employees on our
            pay scale to complete the projects. We support Entrepreneurship
            Development Program in which we also provide employees to the
            startups.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            At SEED, our purpose is to provide multiple services to the
            companies by completing their projects on time. We are giving
            employment to the people on our end and completing govt. and
            non-govt. projects by taking the tender of work. We have direct
            contacts with Companies which are working on project basis and hire
            employees only for the project period, whereas we take projects from
            them and hire employees for a permanent period on our pay scale.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            We are going to open incubation centres in every district in India
            where we will support the Entrepreneurship Development Program. New
            Entrepreneurs will be guided by us for fund raising and we will also
            provide funds to them on our end. This way new entrepreneurs will
            start businesses in which the employment of the people will be done
            from our end. We take bids from companies on different projects and
            employ people on our end and our pay scale. This way the project
            work will be done for companies and the unemployed people will also
            get the jobs.
